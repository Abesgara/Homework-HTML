                <ol> 
                    <li>One of the hobbies that I practice daily, and which for other people may be a trivial thing, is when I drink <a href="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1514845994104-1be22149278b?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=1000&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8Y291cGxlJTIwY29mZmVlfGVufDB8fDB8fHww">coffee</a> with my girlfriend.
                        Coming home from work and finding my girlfriend waiting for me with coffee on the table, ready to discuss what happened during the day, it became a hobby for me, which I can't get enough of it.

         <br> 
             
                <li>Another hobby that we luckily share is <a href="https://www.esports.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/league-wallpaper-e1689679247425.webp">playing video games on the computer.</a>.
                    Before I used to spend 5-6 hours/day just playing, but a year ago I managed to find the "success formula" by which I significantly reduced the time spent playing and increased the time spent together doing other activities.

            <li>Another hobby that I developed when I received my first pair of headphones and my first phone was music. Not two hours pass without listening to music.
                It has become something without which I cannot spend my day in a happy or relaxed way. I like several genres of music, but my favorite genres are <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/27/125427-050-28FB4BA8/Louis-Armstrong-1953.jpg">Jazz</a> and <a href="https://img.redbull.com/images/c_limit,w_1500,h_1000,f_auto,q_auto/redbullcom/2019/03/15/4e2638cc-3c74-4ab4-abb7-5b9cb5aa8b7e/gravediggaz-horrorcore-hip-hop">Hip Hop. </a>
